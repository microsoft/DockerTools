# Visual Studio 2017 Tools for Docker 
The current tooling supports building and debugging .NET Framework web/console applications using Windows containers or .Net Core web/console applications using Linux containers. The tooling requires installing  [Docker For Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) separately from Visual Studio. 

<b><i>This repo is currently used solely as a location to log issues against the latest release of the tooling that is integrated into the Visual Studio 2017 product.</i></b>
